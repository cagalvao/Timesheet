# Timesheet
This is the final project of my Computer Engineering graduation course, presented in June/2018.

The idea was to implement several aspects of modern software engineering by developing a simple aplication, where employees can register 
their arrival and departure time from work, but using very interesting practices such as Infrastructure as Code, live API documentation,
Dockerized services, e2e UI regressive testing, unit testing, static code analysis and code coverage.

These were the technologies used:

Front-end: React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Webpack
Static Code Analysis: ESLint
Back-end: Node.js Express
API Unit Testing: Mocha.js
API Code Coverage: Istanbul
Database: MySQL
Containers: Docker
API Documentation: Swagger.IO
e2e UI Testing: Nightwatch.js
